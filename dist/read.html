              <h2>29th July 2019</h2>
              <p>The time now is about 1517 hours in the afternoon. I am in Kisumu, Mamboleo, NHC Estate.
                Something has got me thinking today. During the time of Jesus, when He first hit the landscape, there was no one who knew the message about the Kingdom of God. Don’t quote me on this, because I also have to go and confirm in the Bible. 
                The only message that they heard was from the John the Baptist, as addressed in the book of The Prophet Isaiah, “A voice of once calling in the desert, prepare ye the way of the LORD.” And even then, the message was delivered to the whole of Israel, to the point where the Pharisees were too scared to approach him. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, as the message was delivered to all Israel, I was thinking this, everyone heard it, and I know that John the Baptist is the reincarnate Prophet Elijah, and I also know that the Prophet Elijah comes to restore all things, to restore the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers, which means that there also had to be a great movement of revival in all Israel towards the message and towards the Messenger. 
                But when the Messiah now came, Israel refuses to accept HIM as the Messiah. My point is this, that at that time, it also looked like everyone who heard the message was also going to accept the Messiah (and I am equating this to entering The Kingdom of Heaven, The Kingdom of Eternity, The Kingdom of GOD THE FATHER; The Kingdom of Jehovah Yahweh). 
                And then I began to think, that if that is truly the case, then isn’t it the same as now? The same as this generation that we are living in? Right now in this move of God, this revival is so high that literally everyone on this earth has heard the message, and every nation has accepted the Message and therefore, the Messengers. But then, what if the nation has accepted the Message, but the people of the nation have not? 
                Because I have also been wondering, that the LORD does not punish the righteous. Therefore, if we are in the Ministry of Repentance and Holiness, and the people in this Ministry have accepted and embraced Repentance, then how come the LORD is still proclaiming judgement on the nations of the earth? Because there is proof in the Bible in Genesis 18 that the LORD wouldn't punish an entire nation if there were only 10 righteous people in that nation. 
              </p>
              <p>
                And then I had this terrible realisation, this horrible feeling in my stomach; that what if the LORD were to come now, at this very moment, at 1539 hours this afternoon, on this Monday the 29th July 2019? What if indeed? Would HE find anyone righteous? And then it got me thinking, I am writing this, but have I prepared myself? Because we have been taught that on that day nothing else will matter except <strong>preparedness.</strong> 
                There has been a serious wave that has been passing through the church since January. Like a winnowing fan, that even some people who were in this Glorious Move of God, no longer are. And those were some pretty strong people. And then I got to do some more thinking.
                During the time of Noah, there had to be some people who helped him (at least for a while, otherwise they would have also been saved). And then I did some more thinking, in the likes of this manner; what if, because while Noah was building the Ark, he was also preaching to the people about an impending flood, so what if the people who heard him (those who heard him for a while) decided to follow him, and help him build the Ark? And what if they were so violent towards salvation in the beginning that they decided to cut off from the world and completely subject themselves to GOD? And then, what if, just what if, when they saw that the flood was taking too long to come (because Noah built the Ark for 120 years, which is longer than the lifetime of anyone in this generation), they decided to just slip back into the world, just a bit… What if indeed? And then, what if, when they slipped back into the world, that’s when the flood came? And what if they were the ones who were knocking on the door of the Ark pleading for Noah to open it? 
                Because for me I know, that when the LORD is angry, then even HIS Prophets and Messengers are angry. And so I did some more thinking; what if the only reason that Noah could have compassion on those people could have been that he knew them on a personal level? 
                Again I say this, if anyone ever gets to read this, don’t quote me. This is just my imagination; just thinking out loud.
