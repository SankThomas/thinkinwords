          <h1><strong>19th November 2019, 12:55pm</strong></h1>
            <p>
             And these are my thoughts this afternoon:
             On earth, whenever there is a wedding, there are always invitations that are sent out, and they invitations usually say something like, “We, Mr. and Mrs. ………., with the blessings of our parents, invite you to our wedding celebration on the ……..” and then they put the date there. And then they write down there, “RSVP”
            </p>
            <p> 
            Now, this has hit me very hard today, because, normally, preparations for that wedding start immediately. The budget is drawn, and ways to meet the financial target are set, and then everything is done. If there is anything to hire, it is done very quickly. The bridesmaids go and get their dresses ready, and the groom’s men as well get their suits ready. Yaani, preparations go on until the day of the wedding.
            And then the day comes, everyone wakes up early in the morning, very early while it’s still dark and everyone is asleep. Sometimes even you can’t sleep at night, you are too nervous and have to stay awake so that this day does not pass you by. 
            But then I have been asking myself this, THE TWO TREMENDOUS PROPHETS OF THE LORD JEHOVAH YAHWEH have been trumpeting and going to the entire world, and saying that THE DAY OF THE WEDDING OF THE LAMB is coming. Ever since they came to us that has always been the message. That let us prepare for the wedding of THE LAMB. And just right now, it has dawned in me that I have not been preparing for that Day at all. I have not prepared my garments, I have not prepared in righteousness and in absolute holiness. I have tolerated sin here and there, even had girlfriends along the way, and lying to people, and cowardice. 
            </p>
            <p> 
            Why? When the WEDDING OF THE LAMB is very near? Surely I repent for laxity and sluggishness. Please LORD forgive me. 
          
            Right now the time is 1:07pm, and I have decided, with this as written proof, that I am now beginning proper preparation for THAT DAY; that I may enter now through the narrow road, so that when THAT DAY does happen, I may be found inside already; just worshiping THE LORD OF ALL THE EARTH; THE KING OF THE UNIVERSE; THE REDEEMER; THE SAVIOUR; THE COMFORTER; THE COUNSELOR; THE WONDERFUL COUNSELOR; THE WONDERFUL ONE; THE POWERFUL ONE; THE MIGHTY ONE; THE LORD MOST HIGH. 
          
            Ooh Jesus, how much longer?
