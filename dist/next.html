                <h2>The Sword Of THE LORD</h2>
                <p>I was in form 3 in 2014.
                    I don’t really remember much about this. The paper on which I wrote it down; I misplaced it, now I have to rely on my memory, and that has not always worked out well, especially during exams. 
                    The time was about 5am in the morning, I woke up frantically and shaking, a bit cold, but I didn’t care. I had had a dream that I needed to recount correctly. I needed to write it down somewhere.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    That dream shook me, I was scared. This is what I saw. 
                    I was in school, walking past the arboretum when I looked up into the sky. In the sky, I could see 7 moons arranges in order from the largest to the smallest. I wondered what that meant (I still do). So I decided to get a better vantage point. There was some gravel nearby and I climbed to the top so that I could get a view higher than the trees to see the events happening in the heavens clearer. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    And then I saw a huge sword, a huge sword I don’t know how to describe the hugeness of that sword. And it came from one direction, and pierced all the 7 moons, and I wondered, what is this that I am seeing? 
                    
                    And just as I was struggling to understand this, I saw Joram coming towards me carrying some books, and I was eager to tell him what I had just seen because I thought that he could help me understand it. But before I could say anything, Joram uttered the following words that jolted me from my sleep: “The Sword of THE LORD has been released.”
